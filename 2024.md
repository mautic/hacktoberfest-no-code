## About Mautic

[Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/) is the worldâ€™s largest open source marketing automation project. With over 200,000 organisations using Mautic and over 1,000 community volunteers, we empower businesses by making it easy to manage their marketing across a range of channels. 

## What is Hacktoberfest?

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is an annual event encouraging contributions to open source projects. Throughout October, participants are invited to submit contributions to open source repositories like Mautic. Contributions can be code, documentation, design, translations, or community support. This repository was initially created to support the Hacktoberfest event but we're going to use it year-round due to the success of Hacktoberfest.

## Why low- and no-code contributions matter

Open source projects thrive not only from code contributions but also from the community's efforts in other areas. Low- and no-code contributions help Mautic grow and improve through better documentation, translations, community support, and more. If you're not a developer but want to contribute to open source, there are plenty of ways to get involved!

7. **Submit Your Contribution**  
For documentation, submit your work via a pull request on GitHub - if you're contributing in October make sure to reference Hacktoberfest in your contribution notes so that the team know to add the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label. For other tasks like translations or writing on the knowledgebase, follow the submission process on Transifex or the knowledgebase and then follow the steps below to have your contribution validated and counted. 
   
For low- and no-code contributions where there is no pull request to make (e.g. marketing, design etc) we've created this file in this repository where we will maintain an activity log, which will allow you to submit a pull request (so that it counts for Hacktoberfest and as a Mautic contribution) each time you complete a task. Please note: some teams work on Jira, and those issues are automatically counted as a contribution when they are completed and assigned to a person, so you don't need to make a PR here for those tasks.

To make a PR to have your contribution counted, follow these steps:

1. Log in to GitHub with your GitHub account
2. Click the Fork button at the top right of this repository
3. Edit the relevant file for the current year, and add your contribution and a link to the issue at the bottom of the list. Follow any instructions that are written as to the formatting to use
4. Click the button to commit your changes, and make a new branch (ideally call it something relevant to this contribution, so you know what each one is)
5. Go back to the [Mautic low and no-code](https://github.com/mautic/low-no-code) repository
6. Click the button at the top of the page to make a new pull request
7. Add the details about your contribution, and submit the pull request for the team to review
8. Celebrate! ðŸ¥³

Please follow this process for each contribution, so that it counts for Hacktoberfest/for Mautic's contributions. The team will add the label 'hacktoberfest-accepted' for relevant contributions, which will allow you to have your contributions counted.

8. **Get Your Rewards**  
   After contributing to four eligible open source repositories during Hacktoberfest, youâ€™ll earn a limited-edition Mautic Hacktoberfest digital badges. For other contributions we're working on unique holopin badges - watch this space!
